Exercise 1:
    Scenario 1:
        1. Hit rate is 0 because step size is 8 bytes and block size is 8 bytes, so every time we write to cache, we must replace it.
        2. The hit rate won't increase because we will never hit.
        3. Make step size less than block size will increase hit rate.
    Scenario 2:
        1. There are 2 memory access per iteration.
        2. mhhh mhhh mhhh mhhh
        3. 0.75
        4. 256bytes functions 256bytes 256bytes
    Scenario 3
        1. 0.5 0
        2. 32 16
        3. 16
        4. larger L2 block size
        5. increase number of blocks in L1 : L1 L2 hit rate stay same
           increase L1 block size : L1 hit rate increase, L2 stay same
